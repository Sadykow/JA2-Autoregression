\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}
There has been multiple publications around usage of widely used Time-Series model, such as LSTM or GRU, for battery state of charge prediction.
Most were isolated to closed scenarios with provided data or from battery cycling machine.
The most promessing approches to improve a model and make it more universal is to increase complexity. While some introduced deeper layer newtwork, others added additional mechanisms to already used.
