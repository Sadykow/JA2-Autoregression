    ABSTRACT = {Currently, despite the use of renewable energy sources (RESs), distribution networks are facing problems, such as complexity and low productivity. Emerging microgrids (MGs) with RESs based on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) are an effective solution to control, manage, and finally deal with these challenges. The development and success of MGs is highly dependent on the use of power electronic interfaces. The use of these interfaces is directly related to the progress of SCADA systems and communication infrastructures. The use of SCADA systems for the control and operation of MGs and active distribution networks promotes productivity and efficiency. This paper presents a real MG case study called the LAMBDA MG testbed laboratory, which has been implemented in the electrical department of the Sapienza University of Rome with a centralized energy management system (CEMS). The real-time results of the SCADA system show that a CEMS can create proper energy balance in a LAMBDA MG testbed and, consequently, minimize the exchange power of the LAMBDA MG and main grid.},

	abstract = {Industrial advances and academic enquiry into the transition towards electrified mobility has been arguably preoccupied with the earlier phases of technological development, while less consideration has been given to the end-of-life phase. One example of this is the current technical and economic difficulties surrounding Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) recycling; and specifically, their high voltage lithium-ion batteries. In this study of the automotive sector, we adopt a longer-term perspective to better understand the overall transition towards “zero-emissions” road transport by empirically and theoretically contributing to the strategic management of lithium-ion powered, vehicle electrification. Through the careful exploration of BEV end-of-life, this paper forecasts a dynamic end-of-life stockpile of lithium-ion batteries, using the UK as a case study. By establishing the ‘dynamic stockpile’ as the central problématique, this paper then describes various technical challenges, business model implications and policy debates around reuse, recycling and disposal that countries will have to contend with as first generation BEVs begin to enter technological obsolescence. While innovation and technological progress are desirable, industry, governments and society must remain aware – and prepared – for the significant economic and environmental costs and opportunities associated with not only the diffusion, but also the waste generated by new technologies.},

    ABSTRACT={As the most widely used energy storage device in consumer electronic and electric vehicle fields, lithium ion battery (LIB) is closely related to our daily lives, on which its safety is of paramount importance. LIB is a typical multidisciplinary product. A tiny single cell is composed of both organic and inorganic materials in multi scale. In addition, its relatively closure property made it difficult to be studied on line, let alone in the battery pack or system level. Safety, often manifested by stability on abuse, including mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuses, is a quite complicated issue of LIB. Safety has to be guaranteed in large scale application. Here, safety issues related to key materials and cell design techniques will be reviewed. Key materials, including cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, are the fundamental of the battery. Cell design and fabrication techniques also have significant influence on the cell's electrochemical and safety performances. Here, we will summarize the thermal runaway process in single cell level, and some recent advances on battery materials and cell design.}

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a practical usability investigation of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to determine the best-suited machine learning method for estimating electric vehicle (EV) batteries&rsquo; state of charge. Using models from multiple published sources and cross-validation testing with several driving scenarios to determine the state of charge of lithium-ion batteries, we assessed their accuracy and drawbacks. Five models were selected from various published state-of-charge estimation models, based on cell types with GRU or LSTM, and optimisers such as stochastic gradient descent, Adam, Nadam, AdaMax, and Robust Adam, with extensions via momentum calculus or an attention layer. Each method was examined by applying training techniques such as a learning rate scheduler or rollback recovery to speed up the fitting, highlighting the implementation specifics. All this was carried out using the TensorFlow framework, and the implementation was performed as closely to the published sources as possible on openly available battery data. The results highlighted an average percentage accuracy of 96.56% for the correct SoC estimation and several drawbacks of the overall implementation, and we propose potential solutions for further improvement. Every implemented model had a similar drawback, which was the poor capturing of the middle area of charge, applying a higher weight to the voltage than the current. The combination of these techniques into a single custom model could result in a better-suited model, further improving the accuracy.},
