\section{LSTM with Auto-Regression} \label{sec:layer}
\textit{This used to be knowns a Forward Teaching. Until some time it turned into that. Here, I have to use LSTM equations to describe models activation functions and optimivers, Dropout. After, it has to be about how Auto-regression implemented on a psudocode format within a layer.
It still can be done imperatively, but better if we implement a Newly released Library from Tensorflow tf.numpy()}
