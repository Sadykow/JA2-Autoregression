The research was undertaken through funding from the Automotive Engineering Graduate Program (AEGP) in cooperation with the Queensland government and Prohelion industry partner.
%In addition, the research has been conducted with help from Mr Sam Haines, whose input was in assisting with merging machine learning knowledge with practical electrical engineering theory, based on similar research performed on Enhanced Kalman Filter.
%In addition, both Sam and I owe our progress to our Principal and Associate supervisors, Associate Professors David Holmes and Geoff Walker, who have been following our progress through the entire degree of Master of Philosophy.
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the input from other academics Dr Olga Moskvyak, Dr Mahsa Baktashmotlagh and Prof David Lovell, who guided through ideas of potential resolutions to framework-based problems.
Finally, we gratefully acknowledge the original developers of the Machine Learning framework Tensorflow from Google, who wrote detailed guides and documentation for all necessary tools used throughout the investigation~\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.
% Dr Mark Boardmeadow and Mat Allan will be in the third.
